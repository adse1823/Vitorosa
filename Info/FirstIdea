You are the mayor of the town of Vitorosa, a small south American town.
Your townâ€™s major export is flour made from a special kind of wheat called Miracle wheat.
It is processed into flour and exported out of the town every month.
Your wheat needs water from a distant lake. For that you need to generate electricity.
You need to buy coal for that. You use too much coal; the air pollution spoils the crops.
You can use solar energy as an alternative, but it is not efficient enough yet.
You use too much natural energy, the net quantity of wheat harvested drops.
Your task is to get as much wheat produce at the end of the year as possible.
