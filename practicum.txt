Unit 01 Practice Problems

The goal of these "mini practica" is to give you practice with coding problems
similar to those that you will see on the midterm practica. You will be 
required to solve each problem with minimal assistance. You should use these
mini-practica as an opportunity to gauge your preparedness for the exams.

You should create all of your required files in this folder along with these
instructions.

Each mini-practicum counts as a homework assignment. 
======================

1. Create a new Java class named "Practice01" under the "unit02" folder and
   define a static function named "arrayToString" that declares a parameter
   for an int array and returns a String. Your function should translate the
   array into a string in the format "[1, 2, 3]" (do not use the
   Arrays.toString() method to do it for you).


2. Create a JUnit unit test for your Practice01 class. Write at least two tests
   to verify that your arrayToString function is working properly.


3. Define a method named "printLines" that declares parameters for a filename 
   and a lowercase letter. The method should do the following:
   
   a. Print all of the lines in the file that start with the specified letter 
      (uppercase or lowercase). For example, the letter 'y' would match a line
      starting with "You" or "yet". Hint: you can use str.toLowerCase() to get 
      a copy of str with all of the letters converted to lowercase.
   b. Return the number of lines that were printed. 
   c. Handle any exceptions that occur by printing a message. 
   
   Add a main method to the class to test your printLines function with the 
   provided alice.txt file and the letter(s) of your choice. The expected 
   counts for some letters are shown below.

   a  262
   b  76
   c  89
   x  0
   y  37
   z  0
